**This application uses cosine similarity.**

Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between two n-dimensional vectors in an n-dimensional space. It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths (or magnitudes).

We can use the Cosine Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things. We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query. For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that youâ€™ve seen.
